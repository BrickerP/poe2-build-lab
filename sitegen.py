<thead><tr><th>Starter direction</th><th>Why it is beginner-friendly</th><th>Main risk</th><th>First gearing priority</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Ranged elemental caster</td><td>Clear targeting, easier boss spacing, strong learning value for skill/support gems.</td><td>Can feel fragile if you ignore life, resistances, and movement.</td><td>Life, resistances, cast speed, relevant elemental damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minion / companion-oriented Witch</td><td>Extra bodies reduce pressure while you learn enemy attacks.</td><td>Minion scaling can be confusing and patch-sensitive.</td><td>Gem levels, minion damage/survivability, defensive stats on gear.</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Fast recommendation</h2>
<p>For a first character, start with a ranged elemental caster or minion-oriented Witch-style build. They let you learn boss patterns without also fighting melee range, weapon breakpoints, and perfect dodge timing at the same time.</p>
<h2>What makes a good starter build?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low currency dependence:</strong> it should function on campaign rares, not require a rare unique item.</li>
<li><strong>Simple buttons:</strong> one main damage skill, one movement/defense plan, one boss setup.</li>
<li><strong>Clear scaling:</strong> you understand whether to upgrade gem levels, weapon DPS, elemental damage, minion stats, or defenses.</li>
<li><strong>Patch resilience:</strong> if one support gem gets nerfed, the build should still be playable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Beginner mistakes to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Following an endgame showcase without checking whether it works during leveling.</li>
<li>Spending all currency on damage while entering acts with weak resistances and low life.</li>
<li>Changing several systems at once; change one skill/support setup, then test.</li>
<li>Trusting an old guide without checking the patch date.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next step</h2>
<p>Pick one archetype, finish Act 1 with it, and keep notes on deaths: one-shot, damage too low, mana issues, or unclear mechanics. Those notes tell you what to fix before copying a more advanced build.</p>

<p class=\"lede\">Path of Exile 2 is easier when you treat the campaign as a learning lab. Your goal is not to copy a perfect build immediately; your goal is to keep damage, defenses, and movement improving together.</p>
<div class=\"notice\"><strong>Quick answer:</strong> Choose one main skill, support it properly, keep defenses current, upgrade weapons or gem levels often, and read boss attacks instead of face-tanking.</div>
<h2>1. Pick one main damage plan</h2>
<p>New players often equip every interesting skill and end up with no coherent scaling. Start with one main damage skill, one support setup, and one utility or movement option.</p>
<h2>2. Support gems matter</h2>
<p>A support gem can change how a skill behaves, how it scales, or how safe it feels. When comparing supports, test on the same enemy type and ask: does this improve clear speed, boss damage, uptime, or survival?</p>
<h2>3. Upgrade defenses before you feel stuck</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep life or equivalent survivability on gear.</li>
<li>Watch elemental resistances as you enter harder zones.</li>
<li>Use flasks/recovery deliberately; do not wait until every fight is desperate.</li>
<li>Practice dodge timing against bosses before blaming your build.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Replace weak gear frequently</h2>
<p>During leveling, a plain rare item with the right stats can beat a flashy item with irrelevant modifiers. If your damage suddenly falls off, check your weapon, gem level, and support setup first.</p>
<h2>5. Learn from deaths</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Death pattern</th><th>Likely issue</th><th>Fix</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Boss one-shots you</td><td>Too little defense or missing dodge window</td><td>Add life/resists, learn telegraphs, improve spacing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Packs overwhelm you</td><td>Weak clear or poor crowd control</td><td>Improve AoE support, positioning, or utility skill</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fights take too long</td><td>Damage scaling behind curve</td><td>Upgrade weapon/gem/supports, simplify rotation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Always out of resource</td><td>Cost/recovery mismatch</td><td>Change supports, add recovery, avoid over-linking early</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Beginner rule</h2>
<p>If a guide cannot explain how the build works before expensive items, do not use it as your first character.</p>

<h2>How to choose your first class</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pick the combat range you enjoy.</li>
<li>Check whether the build needs a specific item to function.</li>
<li>Prefer clear scaling words: spell damage, elemental damage, minion damage, projectile damage, attack weapon DPS.</li>
<li>Avoid a build that needs three mechanics you do not understand yet.</li>

<h2>What not to overthink</h2>
<p>Do not restart every time a tier list changes. In Early Access, patches move numbers around often. A stable learning build that reaches later content teaches more than rerolling into every trend.</p>
